# crypt
This Application called Crypt monitors the current value of different digital currencies and tokens, along with some
major other services which allow users to compare current prices against older values.

The cryptocurrency market can be very volatile. Each and every person who steps into this field is gambling with millions of rupees. An investor needs educated guess rather than shooting in the dark. One can understand the market by gathering all news and updates on several international incidents like war, calamities, MNC merging etc. This project's aim is to provide a digital platform to everyone so they can keep a tab on their favourite cryptocurrency.
Firstly, the is not limited to only tracking of cryptocurrencies and showing prices of each, through this project we intend to show the futuristic prediction of cryptos available in the market by utilizing Machine Learning (mainly Time Series Forecasting. Thus, one can account this certain parameter for their next investment in any digital currency). Python program for prediction runs at a flask server and output is retrieved.
Secondly, the application (crypt) has a dedicated Chatroom facility where its users can discuss and gather as much information about the market. The chatroom facilitates authorised users to exchange information irrespective of place and time.
Thirdly, this platform provides a module where users can query and retrieve every tweet about a specific crypto, from twitter, which includes hashtag followed by name of cryptocurrency. Thus, user can be updated about what and all news going on the market and can utilise this information for their investment.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
